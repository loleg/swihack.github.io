# Multilingual Media Hackathon

On **Feb. 21 and 22, 2020**, Switzerland’s first <u>Multilingual Media Hackathon</u> will take place in Bern at the newsroom of **SWI swissinfo.ch**, the international service of the Swiss public broadcaster SRG-SSR.

At SWI, we publish in ten languages. Our daily news meetings involve discussions in at least three, sometimes five, languages. This degree of diversity could be seen as a liability; we consider it our greatest asset.

We will bring together journalists, coders, designers, and experts in multilingualism to find better solutions to elevate our linguistic diversity. We want to collaboratively work on solutions for multilingual media content productions, including text, video, and graphics.

We’re excited that interested people of linguistic diversity from a wide range of countries and backgrounds have already signed up. If you would also like to join, [please let us know here](https://pollunit.com/en/polls/anthlxx_l2md5ncw7r1csw). We’ll notify you if you’re in or on the waiting list and a spot frees up. We can host a maximum of about 35 people.

## Why should you join?

This is particularly exciting for us at SWI because this is the first time we are opening our doors to such a gathering of likeminded advocates of diversity. Join us to become part of our ongoing conversation about the future of multilingual media in Switzerland and beyond.

## Who can join?

Everyone. You.

The hackathon is open to everyone interested in journalism, in the opportunities and challenges of publishing in several languages, in automatic translation and, more generally, in finding innovative solutions for multilingual and multicultural journalism. As an international public service broadcaster, we want to reach and serve as many people as possible.

## What will we do at the hackathon?

You can find an overview of the already submitted project ideas and challenges above. If you would like to start such a project, please register at the top of the page. We need coders! But we also need journalists! And designers! And anyone who has a **passion for linguistic diversity and an open mind**.

Here’s a wider list of things we could tackle together:

- Translate/adapt long-form stories
- Translate/adapt breaking news
- Translate/adapt/visualise comments
- Multilingual video workflows, also on social media
- Translation workflows in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop
- Workflows with programming languages: R, Python, Javascript
- How to get the most out of APIs and spreadsheets
- Multilingual transcription and instant translations
